# MoneyLand 2D

A game made in Godot4.
One of my first games in Godot, it taught me how to code small systems and how to work with signals properly.
All of the pixel-arts and animations was done by me in Aseprite.
The game unfortinatally doesn't have sound because it wasn't in my goals of learining in this game.

Hope it is usefull to you :)
