# [Project Name]

![Godot Version](https://img.shields.io/badge/Godot-4.x-%23478cbf?logo=godot-engine)

An small game I made in my journy to learning Godot after I migrated from Unity.
It's an Idle game with no sound unfortunately because sound design wasn't part of my plan for this project.
All the pixel art animation was done by me in Aseprite, it was a learning experience too

## Features

- Polished custom UI
- Smooth pixelart Animations
